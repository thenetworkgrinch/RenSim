# RemSim

RemSim is a modular FRC physics library for simulation, analysis, and robotics workflow integration.

### Key Capabilities (implementaion ongoing)
- **Unified Physics Engine:**
  - Rigid body, drivetrain, and mechanism simulation
  - Realistic field, collision, and sensor modeling
- **Multi-language Bindings:**
  - Native C++ core
  - Python and Java bindings for rapid prototyping and integration
- **Simulation Runtime:**
  - Plug-and-play robot code simulation
  - Sensor pipelines and WPILib bridge
- **CAD Import:**
  - Load URDF, STL, and more for custom robots and fields
- **Extensible & Modular:**
  - Add your own models, forces, and plugins

### Project Goals
- **Accuracy:** Realistic, physically-based simulation for FRC robots and game elements
- **Integration:** Seamless workflow from CAD to code to simulation
- **Accessibility:** Usable by teams of all experience levels, with Python/Java/C++ support
- **Open Source:** Community-driven, MIT-licensed
